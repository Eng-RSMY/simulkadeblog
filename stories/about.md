# About me
<img src="http://googledrive.com/host/0B8OOfC6oWXEPd1JXZTNlSjItRzQ" />  
My name is Ali Akbar Eftekhari. My family and friends call me Ehsan. I currently live in Delft, the Netherlands with my wife, Maryam, and my daughter, Aida. I am a post-doc in the Section of [Petroleum Engineering](http://www.citg.tudelft.nl/en/about-faculty/departments/geoscience-engineering/sections/petroleum-engineering/) at the [TU Delft](http://www.tudelft.nl/en/).  
I have [a twitter account](https://twitter.com/aidadaddy) that is barely used, a [Google scholar profile](http://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=hBKHOIcAAAAJ&hl=en) where you can see a list of my publications, and a [github account](https://github.com/simulkade) where you can find some of my codes.  
Her's my [CV](http://www.simulkade.com/stories/cv.html).

## Profile
I am a Chemical and Petroleum Engineering graduate with several years of experience in the modeling and simulation of [upstream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_%28petroleum_industry%29) and [downstream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downstream_%28petroleum_industry%29) oil and gas processes. Besides working with [commercial simulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chemical_process_simulators), I have developed prototype computer tools for the modeling and simulation of multicomponent multiphase flow in porous media and [phase equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor%E2%80%93liquid_equilibrium) computations. I have designed and conducted core-flooding experiments for [enhanced oil recovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery), including [water](http://petrowiki.org/Waterflooding), [gas](http://petrowiki.org/PEH%3AImmiscible_Gas_Injection_in_Oil_Reservoirs), [polymer](http://petrowiki.org/Polymer_waterflooding), and [foam](http://petrowiki.org/Foam_behavior_in_porous_media) flooding. My main interest are [exergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exergy) analysis of the energy conversion processes and investigation of various physical and chemical interactions (fluid-fluid, rock-fluid) in flow of [multiphase fluids in porous media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_flow_through_porous_media). I am also interested in numerical methods and computer programming, fluid phase equilibria, and [process simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_simulation) and optimization.
