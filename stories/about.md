# About me
My name is Ali Akbar Eftekhari. My family and friends call me Ehsan. I currently live in Lyngby, Denmark with my wife, Maryam, our daughter, Aida, and our son Aidin. I am a post-doc researcher in the [Centre for Oil and Gas](http://www.oilgas.dtu.dk/english) at the [Technical University of Denmark](http://www.dtu.dk).  
I have [a twitter account](https://twitter.com/aidadaddy) that is barely used, a [Google scholar profile](http://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=hBKHOIcAAAAJ&hl=en) where you can see a list of my publications, and a [github account](https://github.com/simulkade) where you can find some of my codes. You can find my CV [here](http://www.simulkade.com/stories/cv.html).
