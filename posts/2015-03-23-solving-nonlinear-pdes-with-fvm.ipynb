    "There are many cases where the transfer coefficient in the convection-diffusion equations is a function of the independent variable. This makes the PDE nonlinear. While working on my thesis, I realized that it is not that difficult to use the Taylor expansion to linearize the nonlinear terms in a PDE. Here, I'm going to give a simple example. In another post, I will explain how the same idea can be used to numerically solve the Buckley-Leverett equation."
