# About me
<img src="http://googledrive.com/host/0B8OOfC6oWXEPd1JXZTNlSjItRzQ" />  
My name is Ali Akbar Eftekhari. My family and friends call me Ehsan. I currently live in Delft, the Netherlands with my wife, Maryam, and my daughter, Aida. I am a post-doc in the Section of [Petroleum Engineering](http://www.citg.tudelft.nl/en/about-faculty/departments/geoscience-engineering/sections/petroleum-engineering/) at the [TU Delft](http://www.tudelft.nl/en/).  
I have [a twitter account](https://twitter.com/aidadaddy) that is barely used, a [Google scholar profile](http://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=hBKHOIcAAAAJ&hl=en) where you can see a list of my publications, and a [github account](https://github.com/simulkade) where you can find some of my codes.
